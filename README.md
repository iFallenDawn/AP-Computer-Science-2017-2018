# AP Computer Science 2017-2018
Consists of various projects and assignments given to us during the school year.

## American Computer Science League Contests 2017-2018
This includes the folders labelled, Enclosure, Walk, and Ninety-Nine.

### Ninety-Nine
**PROBLEM:** ACSL Ninety-Nine is a two-player card game played with a standard deck of 52-
cards (2 â€“ 9, T, J, Q, K, A). To start, each player is dealt 3 cards and the remaining cards are
placed face down on the table (the pile). In an actual game the point total is set to zero, but for
this program an initial point total will be given. Each player in turn puts down one card and
changes the point total according to the point value of his card and then selects a card from the
top of the pile. Each card adds its face value in points (e.g. a 5 is worth five points, a T is worth
10 points, a J is worth 11 points, a Q is worth 12 points, a K is worth 13 points and an A is
worth 14 points) except for certain cards that have special values or meanings:

```
- A 9 is a pass (and does not change point total).
- A T subtracts 10 points from the total.
- An A adds either 1 or 14 to the point total. The 14 is played first as long as it does not put
the point total over 99.```

Cards are played using the following rule: Play the largest face value card.
The game ends when the card played puts the point total over 99.

### Walk
I think at this point I was used to doing a Brute Force Algorithm and checking for every possible combination, as my grade was on the line.
